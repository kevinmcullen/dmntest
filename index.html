            <p class="intro"><span class="dropcap">F</span>or 31-year-old Jenna Owens, her seven years on the Kidd Kraddick Morning Show have been her own Apollo 13. When Kraddick picked her to be the youngest co-host of his nationally syndicated morning radio show, she was on a rocket trip to the moon. A nationally syndicated TV show, DISH Nation, soon followed. Then in 2013, things went shockingly, devastatingly wrong. On <a href="http://www.dallasnews.com/news/local-news/20130727-dallas-radio-host-kidd-kraddick-dies.ece">July 27,</a> a nauseous and sweaty Kraddick left Owens standing on the first tee at the Timberlane Country Club in a New Orleans suburb and returned to his air-conditioned limousine bus. There, he collapsed and died. He was 53.<br><br>Without its leader, the Kraddick show was marked for extinction. But through talent and perseverance, Kellie Rasberry, Big Al Mack, Jose &ldquo;J-Si&rdquo; Chavez and Owens have carried the Kidd Kraddick Morning Show to <a href="http://res.dallasnews.com/interactives/not-kidds-anymore/">new ratings heights.</a> No longer just the team&rsquo;s ingenue, Owens is now a seasoned counterpuncher, providing wry insight into the morning commute in <a href="http://www.kiddkraddickinfo.com/affiliates/">68 radio markets nationwide.</a></p>

            <p><strong class="ap">ALAN PEPPARD:</strong> I once heard Walter Cronkite say that his fame made visiting a brothel difficult. When do you find fame inconvenient?</p>

            <p><strong class="jo">JENNA OWENS:</strong> The gynecologist. That was actually my first taste of fame, though taste is probably not the choice of words to use there. The first time I was ever recognized was mid-exam. The doctor could hear me but not see me. She slid over and looked up and said, &ldquo;Oh, my God, now I know who you are.&rdquo; I walked out of the office and thought, &ldquo;This isn&rsquo;t what I thought fame would be like.&rdquo; I always assumed it would be when you&rsquo;re dressed up looking your best at dinner. It&rsquo;s a lesson. If you&rsquo;re in a bad mood or don&rsquo;t feel like putting on a bra, don&rsquo;t go out.</p>

            <p><strong class="ap">AP:</strong> We last talked in depth one year after Kidd Kraddick died. You were visibly shaken. Now, it&rsquo;s been two years. The show isn&rsquo;t merely succeeding, it&rsquo;s conquering. Are you healing?</p>

            <p><strong class="jo">JO:</strong> To be honest, I have never been happier in my life and never felt better than I do at this moment. I had a lot of grief. I lost my mentor &mdash; one of my closest confidantes in life. And then, I had to put my dog, my best friend, to sleep. It almost felt like too much to handle. It&rsquo;s weird to have such a public job and feel such darkness. But just putting one foot in front of the other, you get through those things. I woke up one day and felt there&rsquo;s nothing else to lose, and I felt at peace with everything.</p>

            <p><strong class="ap">AP:</strong> How long did you have your pug Max?</p>

            <p><strong class="jo">JO:</strong> I had Max for 11 years. I got him in Chicago on the side of a highway out of the back of a van and took him to college. Our relationship was intense. He became a celebrity. He was on the TV show. I only started dressing him up in costume in his senior years. He got diabetes and he was just days away from dying. I had to give him two shots a day. I wanted him to make it to his 11th birthday, and he made it. We threw him a denim-on-denim party. Then, my three best girlfriends offered to go with me to put him to sleep. First, we took him to McDonald&rsquo;s and he got a burger and fries. He was so happy.</p>
          
          

            <p><strong class="ap">AP:</strong> You have a previous life as a jock. Why did that end?</p>

            <p><strong class="jo">JO:</strong> I don&rsquo;t think there was anything in this life I was better at than playing soccer. I was such a tomboy, you would not have recognized me. I decided to stop playing when I started visiting colleges with offers for full scholarships. I got very burned out. I had the ability but not the heart. At some point, I wanted a career and a job. I didn&rsquo;t see a future for myself playing soccer.</p>

            <p><strong class="ap">AP:</strong> You and I had a recent conversation about Charles Manson. Your encyclopedic knowledge was startling. What&rsquo;s the fascination with psychos and serial killers?</p>

            <p><strong class="jo">JO:</strong> I think evil is more interesting than good. Everyone has the potential to be good. The evil is what is so foreign to people. I&rsquo;ve always had a fascination with psychology. When I was a child, my dad had every Stephen King book. I loved them. I loved horror movies, but I was so young, I couldn&rsquo;t say horror. I would say, &ldquo;I wanna go to a whore movie.&rdquo; If I didn&rsquo;t have this career, I would have gone back to school to study criminal psychology.</p>

            <p><strong class="ap">AP:</strong> Your workday doesn&rsquo;t end when you go off the air at 10 a.m. After that, you tape a nationally syndicated TV show, DISH Nation. What&rsquo;s the biggest misconception about your schedule?</p>

            <p><strong class="jo">JO:</strong> That we roll in, turn on those microphones, gab and gossip for four hours then say, &ldquo;Bye, see you tomorrow.&rdquo; Sounding effortless takes quite a lot of effort. That&rsquo;s the goal, though &mdash; to sit around like we&rsquo;re having a conversation at the breakfast table and you are a part of it. But there&rsquo;s definitely a lot of work that goes into that.</p>

            <p><strong class="ap">AP:</strong> Kidd was known as &ldquo;No Sleep Kidd&rdquo; and it certainly didn&rsquo;t help his health. You get up at 4 a.m. Do you worry about your sleep and its effects on your health?</p>

            <p><strong class="jo">JO:</strong> I&rsquo;ve never in my life been a worrier, and I absolutely worry about what the sleep schedule does to me. I can feel it. I can feel it every day. The most common question I get is &ldquo;What time do you have to get up?&rdquo; Now, I just tell people, &ldquo;Yesterday.&rdquo;</p>

          <p><strong class="ap">AP:</strong> With Kellie Rasberry and Big Al Mack creeping into middle age, you were hired to bring the young person&rsquo;s perspective and add some dating drama. To some extent you&rsquo;ve lived your dating life in public. How&rsquo;s that working for you?</p>


            <p><strong class="jo">JO:</strong> I would never blame the job for my lack of a relationship or any problems I&rsquo;ve had. I think it&rsquo;s more being a fiercely independent, opinionated, successful woman. It&rsquo;s very hard to find a man who can deal with that. I can&rsquo;t tell you how many guys say, &ldquo;I want a girl like you,&rdquo; but when it comes down to it, I don&rsquo;t think that&rsquo;s the case. </p>

            <p><strong class="ap">AP:</strong> On your Instagram account jennasrack, you have such beautiful shots of you in different fashions. A refined aesthetic sense is not something one associates with a radio personality. Where does yours come from?</p>      

            <p><strong class="jo">JO:</strong> I&rsquo;ve always had very good radar on what is going to be fashionable, but I also take into consideration what&rsquo;s flattering. Everything comes down to how does this express my personality. For jennasrack, I give all the credit to a couple of my best friends who think I am a star. They put me on this platform that is so unwarranted. It&rsquo;s supposed to be tongue-in-cheek. It&rsquo;s captured through the eyes of a guy. The jennasrack name was created by my best guy friend. Who else would come up with that but a guy? The account is tied in to liketoknow.it, [Dallas-based] Amber Venz&rsquo;s brilliant concept for linking up fashion bloggers with retailers.</p>

            <p><strong class="jo">JO:</strong> How much am I going to deflect this question? It&rsquo;s hard. You get tired earlier. You go to bed earlier. You get up earlier. It&rsquo;s definitely hard to find someone who can live on the same schedule. I&rsquo;m not negative enough yet to think I won&rsquo;t have a successful relationship because of my job. I&rsquo;m not concerned about being married, but I am excited about sharing my life with someone. I&rsquo;m not going to be cooking you dinner, but I can buy you dinner. </p>
